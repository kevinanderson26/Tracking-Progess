Data User Notice posted on April 20, 2017: In July 2016, Census Bureau staff identified a processing error that affects selected data from the 2014 County Business Patterns (CBP). At that time, we suppressed the affected estimates in published tables. With the release of the 2015 CBP, we revised the 2014 employment and payroll totals in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector (Sector 62) for the following geographies: U.S.; Michigan; Battle Creek, MI metro area; Calhoun County, MI; and the 3rd congressional district of Michigan. This processing error did not affect other sectors.
